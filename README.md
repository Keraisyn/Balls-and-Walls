# Balls-and-Walls
A fun physics game made with Tkinter where you draw walls to bounce balls into a crate.

## Information
In Balls and Walls, there is a cannon that shoots a ball which the player must get into a crate. In order to accomplish this goal, the player can draw a set number of walls that bounce the ball into the crate. Balls and Walls also comes complete with a level editor so you can edit and create your own levels!

## How to use
Clone the repository and run BallsAndWalls.py. You may need to open in IDLE or another editor beforehand.

## Purpose
Balls and Walls was created for my computer science class's final project.
